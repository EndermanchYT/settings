# Settings

- ‚öôÔ∏è Settings application for dahliaOS.
- üíô Written in Dart/Flutter.

## Development

To develop and locally test the Settings application:

### Step 1. Install development tools

1. Install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
2. Install an IDE of your choice (we recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
    * We also recommend installing Dart and Flutter extensions if you're opting in for VSCode.
    For other IDEs, please inform yourself.

### Step 2. Install dependencies

Install pub dependencies required to run the Settings application by running:

```dart
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3. Run Settings application

**Note**: You can run the Settings application on any platform that Flutter supports but we recommend running it on Linux as some features of the application are designed exclusively for Linux and won't work on other platforms.

Run the Settings application by running:

```dart
flutter run
```

Flutter has hot reloading so no need to restart the instance when it's running!
